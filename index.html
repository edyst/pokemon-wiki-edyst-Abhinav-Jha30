                    out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
                    themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July
                    and December.

            <h6 style="font-size: 18px;">Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h6>
            <ol>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
                    <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
                </ul>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</li>
                    <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

                The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original Green version was not released outside Japan
